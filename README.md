# sort
Personal JS sorting library. WIP.

### TODO
- Include build tools
  - Compile
  - Compress
  - Uglify
  - Gzip
- Write tests
  - Standard
  - Unit tests

### Known problems
- mergeSort is running very slowly, which suggests huge room for improvement. The cause may be due to usage of excessive arrays.
